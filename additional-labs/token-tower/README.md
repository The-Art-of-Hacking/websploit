# Token Tower (JWT Lab)

## Objective
The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Your goal is to bypass the access controls to become 'admin' and retrieve the flag.

## Vulnerabilities
1. **None Algorithm**: The server might accept unsigned tokens.
2. **Weak Secret**: The signing key might be easily brute-forced.

## How to Run
Access the lab at `http://<IP>:5020` or `http://localhost:5020`.
